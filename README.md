# PCPartPicker

An Android app built for people with a desire to build their own custom computer, regardless of their experience level. 

The app allows users to choose the parts they want to put in their PC, with a wide range of options available. As parts are added to a user's configuration, compatibility checks are run to ensure that all the parts the user wishes to use will work without issues. 

PC configurations can be saved by creating an account and/or logging in to PC Part Picker. Price and power usage are also constantly monitored, allowing the user to see, as parts are added, how much their computer will cost and how much electricity it will use. Price charts can be accessed to calculate trends and determine when certain computer parts will decrease in price.
